,[31:24],IRQDelay,8'h00,r/w,Interrupt Delay Timeout. This value is used for setting
,,,,,the interrupt delay timeout value. The interrupt timeout
,,,,,is a mechanism for causing the CDMA engine to generate
,,,,,an interrupt after the delay time period has expired.
,,,,,Timer begins counting at the end of a packet and resets
,,,,,with the receipt of a new packet or a timeout event
,,,,,occurs
,[23:16],IRQThreshold,8'h01,r/w,Interrupt Threshold. This value is used for setting the
,,,,,"interrupt threshold. When IOC interrupt events occur, an"
,,,,,internal counter counts down from the Interrupt
,,,,,"Threshold setting. When the count reaches zero, an"
,,,,,interrupt out is generated by the DMA engine
,15,Reserved,1'h0,ro,Writing to this bit has no effect and it is always read as
,,,,,zeros
,14,Err_IrqEn,1'h0,r/w,"Error Interrupt Enable. When set to 1, it allows the"
,,,,,CDMASR.Err_Irq to generate an interrupt out.
,,,,,0 = Error Interrupt disabled
,,,,,1 = Error Interrupt enabled
,13,Dly_IrqEn,1'h0,r/w,"Delay Timer Interrupt Enable. When set to 1, it allows"
,,,,,CDMASR.Dly_Irq to generate an interrupt out. This is only
,,,,,used with Scatter Gather assisted transfers.
,,,,,0 = Delay Interrupt disabled
,,,,,1 = Delay Interrupt enabled
,12,IOC_IrqEn,1'h0,r/w,"Complete Interrupt Enable. When set to 1, it allows"
,,,,,CDMASR.IOC_Irq to generate an interrupt out for
,,,,,completed DMA transfers.
,,,,,0 = IOC Interrupt disabled
,,,,,1 = IOC Interrupt enabled
,[11:7],Reserved,5'h00,ro,Writing to these bits has no effect and they are always
,,,,,read as zeros
,6,Cyclic_BD_Enable,1'h0,r/w,"When set to 1, you can use the CDMA in Cyclic Buffer"
,,,,,Descriptor (BD) mode without any user intervention. In
,,,,,"this mode, the Scatter Gather module ignores the"
,,,,,"Completed bit of the BD. With this feature, you can use"
,,,,,the same BDs in cyclic manner without worrying about
,,,,,any errors.
,,,,,This bit should be set before updating the TAILDESC
,,,,,register. Changing this bit while the transfer is in progress
,,,,,will generate undefined results
,5,Key_Hole_Write,1'h0,r/w,Writing 1 to this enables the keyhole write (FIXED address
,,,,,AXI transaction). This value should not be changed when
,,,,,a transfer is in progress. This value should remain
,,,,,constant until all the descriptors are processed (for SG =
,,,,,1). CDMA shows unexpected behavior if this value is
,,,,,changed in the middle of a transfer. It is the responsibility
,,,,,of the slave device to enforce the functionality. When
,,,,,"enabling Key Hole operation, the MAX BURST LENGTH"
,,,,,should be set to 16
,4,Key_Hole_Read,1'h0,r/w,Writing 1 to this enables the keyhole read (FIXED address
,,,,,AXI transaction). This value should not be changed when
,,,,,a transfer is in progress. This value should remain
,,,,,constant until all the descriptors are processed (for SG =
,,,,,1). CDMA shows unexpected behavior if this value is
,,,,,changed in the middle of a transfer. It is the responsibility
,,,,,of the slave device to enforce the functionality. When
,,,,,"enabling Key Hole operation, the MAX BURST LENGTH"
,,,,,should be set to 16
,3,SGMode,1'h0,r/w,This bit controls the transfer mode of the CDMA. Setting
,,,,,this bit to a 1 causes the AXI CDMA to operate in a Scatter
,,,,,Gather mode if the Scatter Gather engine is included.
,,,,,0 = Simple DMA Mode
,,,,,1 = Scatter Gather Mode
,,,,,This bit must only be changed when the CDMA engine is
,,,,,idle (CDMASR.IDLE = 1). Changing the state of this bit at
,,,,,any other time has undefined results.
,,,,,This bit must be set to a 0 then back to 1 by the software
,,,,,application to force the CDMA SG engine to use a new
,,,,,value written to the CURDESC_PNTR register.
,,,,,This bit must be set prior to setting the
,,,,,"CDMACR.Dly_IrqEn bit. Otherwise, the"
,,,,,CDMACR.Dly_IrqEn bit does not get set
,2,Reset,1'h0,r/w,Soft reset control for the AXI CDMA core. Setting this bit
,,,,,to a 1 causes the AXI CDMA to be reset. Reset is
,,,,,accomplished gracefully. Committed AXI4 transfers are
,,,,,then completed. Other queued transfers are flushed.
,,,,,"After completion of a soft reset, all registers and bits are"
,,,,,in the Reset State.
,,,,,0 = Reset NOT in progress - Normal operation
,,,,,1 = Reset in progress
,1,TailPntrEn,1'h1,ro,Indicates tail pointer mode is enabled in the SG Engine.
,,,,,This bit is fixed to 1 and always read as 1 when SG is
,,,,,included. If the CDMA is built with SG disabled (Simple
,,,,,"Mode Only), the default value of the port is 0"
,0,Reserved,1'h0,ro,"Writing to these bits has no effect, and they are always"
#,addr = 0x04,CDMAStatus,,,

,,,,,the current interrupt delay timer value in the SG
,,,,,Engine
,[23:16],IRQThresholdSts,8'h01,ro,Interrupt Threshold Status. This field reflects
,,,,,the current interrupt threshold value in the SG
,,,,,Engine
,15,Reserved,1'h0,ro,Always read as zero.
,14,Err_Irq,1'h0,r/w,"Interrupt on Error. When set to 1, this bit"
,,,,,indicates an interrupt event has been generated
,,,,,due to an error condition. If the corresponding
,,,,,"enable bit is set (CDMACR.Err_IrqEn = 1), an"
,,,,,interrupt out is generated from the AXI CDMA.
,,,,,0 = No error Interrupt
,,,,,1 = Error interrupt active
,,,,,Writing a 1 to this bit will clear it
,13,Dly_Irq,1'h0,r/w,"Interrupt on Delay. When set to 1, this bit"

,,,,,"enable bit is set (CDMACR.Dly_IrqEn = 1), an"
,,,,,interrupt out is generated from the AXI CDMA.
,,,,,0 = No Delay Interrupt
,,,,,1 = Delay Interrupt active
,,,,,Writing a 1 to this bit will clear it.
,,,,,This bit is cleared whenever CDMACR.SGMode
,,,,,is set to 0
,12,IOC_Irq,1'h0,r/w,"Interrupt on Complete. When set to 1, this bit"
,,,,,indicates an interrupt event has been generated
,,,,,on completion of a DMA transfer (either a
,,,,,Simple or SG). If the corresponding enable bit is
,,,,,"set (CDMACR.IOC_IrqEn = 1), an interrupt out is"
,,,,,generated from the AXI CDMA.
,,,,,0 = No IOC Interrupt
,,,,,1 = IOC Interrupt active
,,,,,"When operating in SG mode, the criteria"
,,,,,specified by the interrupt threshold must also
,,,,,be met. Writing a 1 to this bit will clear it.
,11,Reserved,1'h0,ro,Writing to this bit has no effect and it is always
,,,,,read as zeros.
,10,SGDecErr,1'h0,ro,Scatter Gather Decode Error. This bit indicates
,,,,,that an AXI decode error has been received by
,,,,,the SG Engine during an AXI transfer (transfer
,,,,,descriptor read or write). This error occurs if the
,,,,,SG Engine issues an address request to an
,,,,,invalid location. This error condition causes the
,,,,,AXI CDMA to gracefully halt. The CDMASR.IDLE
,,,,,bit is set to 1 when the CDMA has completed
,,,,,shut down. The CURDESC_PNTR register is
,,,,,updated with the descriptor pointer value when
,,,,,this error is detected.
,,,,,0 = No SG Decode Errors
,,,,,1 = SG Decode Error detected. CDMA Engine
,,,,,halts.
,,,,,A reset (soft or hard) must be issued to clear the
,,,,,error condition.
,9,SGSlvErr,1'h0,ro,Scatter Gather Slave Error. This bit indicates
,,,,,that an AXI slave error response has been
,,,,,received by the SG Engine during an AXI transfer
,,,,,(transfer descriptor read or write). This error
,,,,,condition causes the AXI CDMA to halt
,,,,,gracefully. The CDMASR.IDLE bit is set to 1 when

,,,,,that an internal error has been encountered by
,,,,,the SG Engine. This error condition causes the
,,,,,AXI CDMA to halt gracefully. The CDMASR.IDLE
,,,,,bit is set to 1 when the CDMA has completed
,,,,,shutdown. The CURDESC_PNTR register is
,,,,,updated with the descriptor pointer value when
,,,,,this error is detected.
,,,,,0 = No SG Internal Errors
,,,,,1 = SG Internal Error detected. CDMA Engine
,,,,,halts.
,,,,,A reset (soft or hard) must be issued to clear the
,,,,,error condition.
,7,Reserved,1'h0,ro,Writing to this bit has no effect and it is always
,,,,,read as zeros.
,6,DMADecErr,1'h0,ro,DMA Decode Error. This bit indicates that an
,,,,,AXI decode error has been received by the AXI
,,,,,DataMover. This error occurs if the DataMover
,,,,,issues an address request to an invalid location.
,,,,,This error condition causes the AXI CDMA to
,,,,,halt gracefully. The CDMASR.IDLE bit is set to 1
,,,,,when the CDMA has completed shut down. The
,,,,,CURDESC_PNTR register is updated with the
,,,,,descriptor pointer value when this error is
,,,,,detected.
,,,,,0 = No CDMA Decode Errors.

,,,,,halts.
,,,,,A reset (soft or hard) must be issued to clear the
,,,,,error condition.
,5,DMASlvErr,1'h0,ro,DMA Slave Error. This bit indicates that an AXI
,,,,,slave error response has been received by the
,,,,,AXI DataMover during an AXI transfer (read or
,,,,,write). This error condition causes the AXI
,,,,,CDMA to halt gracefully. The CDMASR.IDLE bit

,,,,,1 = CDMA Slave Error detected. CDMA Engine
,,,,,halts.
,,,,,A reset (soft or hard) must be issued to clear the
,,,,,error condition.
,4,DMAIntErr,1'h0,ro,DMA Internal Error. This bit indicates that a
,,,,,internal error has been encountered by the
,,,,,DataMover on the data transport channel. This
,,,,,error can occur if a 0 value BTT (bytes to
,,,,,transfer) is fed to the AXI DataMover or
,,,,,DataMover has an internal processing error. A
,,,,,BTT of 0 only happens if the BTT register is
,,,,,written with zeros (in Simple DMA mode) or a
,,,,,BTT specified in the Control word of a fetched
,,,,,descriptor is set to 0 (SG Mode). This error
,,,,,condition causes the AXI CDMA to halt
,,,,,gracefully. The CDMASR.IDLE bit is set to 1 when
,,,,,the CDMA has completed shut down.
,,,,,CURDESC_PNTR register is updated with the
,,,,,descriptor pointer value when this error is
,,,,,detected.
,,,,,0 = No CDMA Internal Errors.

,,,,,DMA operations are supported.
,,,,,1 = Scatter Gather is included. Both Simple DMA
,,,,,and Scatter Gather operations are supported.
,2,Reserved,1'h0,ro,Writing to these bits has no effect and they are
,,,,,always read as zeros.
,1,Idle,1'h0,ro,CDMA Idle. Indicates the state of AXI CDMA
,,,,,operations.
,,,,,"When set and in Simple DMA mode, the bit"
,,,,,indicates the programmed transfer has
,,,,,completed and the CDMA is waiting for a new
,,,,,transfer to be programmed. Writing to the bytes
,,,,,to transfer (BTT) register in Simple DMA mode
,,,,,causes the CDMA to start (not Idle).
,,,,,"When set and in SG mode, the bit indicates the"
,,,,,SG Engine has reached the tail pointer for the
,,,,,associated channel and all queued descriptors
,,,,,have been processed. Writing to the tail pointer
,,,,,register automatically restarts CDMA SG
,,,,,operations.
,,,,,0 = Not Idle - Simple or SG DMA operations are
,,,,,in progress.
,,,,,1 = Idle - Simple or SG operations completed or
,,,,,not started.
,0,Reserved,1'h0,ro,Writing to these bits has no effect and they are
